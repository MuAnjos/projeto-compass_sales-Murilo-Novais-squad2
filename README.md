# Compass UOL Scholarship Program - Week 08 Challenge

Welcome to the repository for the Week 08 Challenge of the Compass UOL Scholarship Program. In this challenge, we were tasked with the creation of a mobile application with signup, login, forgot password, and home page screens and functionalities.

## Challenge Description

The Week 08 Challenge of the Compass UOL Scholarship Program involves the creation of a mobile application with four primary screens and corresponding functionalities:

1. **Signup Screen**: Users should be able to register for the application by providing their name, email address, and a secure password. Proper validation should be implemented to ensure data accuracy and security.

2. **Login Screen**: Registered users can log in to the application using their email and password. Authentication should be performed securely, and error handling should be in place to handle cases such as incorrect passwords or non-existent users.

3. **Forgot Password Screen**: Users who have forgotten their passwords should have the option to reset them. The application should allow users to provide their email address, and upon submission, a password reset email should be sent to that address. Proper validation and error handling are crucial in this functionality.

4. **Home Page Screen**: After successful authentication, users should be redirected to a home page or dashboard. This screen can include various features and information, depending on the application's purpose. It should provide a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used

In this challenge, I utilized the following technologies and tools:

- React Native CLI
- React Navigation
- Firebase Authentication
- React Hook Form
- Yup (for form validation)
- Styled components
